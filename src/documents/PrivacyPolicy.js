            </p>
            <p>
              CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
              websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s
              reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
              company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
              operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
              from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
              its website stating exactly the information being collected and
              those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary
